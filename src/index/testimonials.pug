        #[span "Bliss Integrated Communication has been working with James and Brand Applause for many years.  They are our top pick for video and photo projects for a wide range of client needs – both internal and external.  James is one of a handful of professionals in his field that understands how to work in highly-regulated industries (e.g., healthcare, financial and professional).   He always finds creative and strategic solutions for our clients, in the face of some very conservative mandates.  James’ concise writing and years of experience directing creates real impact and helps Bliss get the most out of customer and client interviews.   Whether its medical training content for television, business development and cultural videos, or a Vlog series/campaign - one call to James and Brand Applause gets it done.”]
